# Answers for the questions in Task-1

## Question/1
## Do you think it is necessary to involve the show owner during the process along the three weeks? Or alternatively, is it better to involve him only when the product is finished? Explain your answer

In my point of view the best way to get feedback while making something like this is having checkpoints and requesting feedback from the show owner once we reach those checkpoint. Because if we show our product and request feedback from the show owner everytime we make a change in the product, it will cost us time loss and we will proggress slower. But on the other hand if we do not request any feedback from the show owner until the end , we might end up with a product that is totally different than what our user has wanted.But one little point I want to add is asking for user feedback all the time might help us with having a produvt which is as close as possible to what the user wants , but might also stop us from creating something new. Because since the user is judging the game off of previous experiences, it takes away the possibility of giving feedback about creating something new. A good example would be a quote from Henry Ford "If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.".

## Question/2
## Watch this video about Minimal Viable Products. Do you think it is necessary to create MVPs for your game? If so, what would some of the MPV look like and what do you expect to obtain from the client?

Yes, I think is it really necessary to create Minimal Viable Products especially in topics like gaming which the whole system is based on if the user has fun while playing the game. As an example, in the first version of the game we might have some topics that we are unsure if the user will like or not. To get user feedback we can make a part where it asks about that topic and if the user replies, they will win something in the game's currency. FOr example we are not sure if we should add ASCII pictures to our game . So we can make a part in the beginning of the game where it gives 10 $ ( or any currency that the game is using) and and asks to user to purchase ASCII pictures in the game. After that it can ask that if the user wants to keep the ASCII images or not , which will give us a feedback about image usage in our game. But one little point I want to add is creating 

## Question/3
## Watch this video about “bad doors”.Do you see similarities between the Human-Centered Design cycle presented in the video and the Design Cycle we use for developing software? Explain.

The biggest similarity which cought my eye was how both of them were change and feedback based. In the Design Cycle we use for developing software, we can see that in the fourth step of the Design Cycle , there is a step called 'Evaluation'. And we can also see that in the second and the third step of the Human-Centered Design Cycle , there are steps called 'Prototyping' and 'Testing. In my opinion , all of the steps that I mentioned has one aim : get feedback and change the product for the better.

## Question/4
## What are the simple principles for human-centered design presented in the video? Write a sentence with the definition of each.

Here below are the two basic principles for human-centered design:

Discoverability:How much of a product you can understand about how it works, just by looking at it's design. My example would be buying a product which has instructions on itseld about how to use a product but it's in another language. How much you can understand about the usage of the product will be 'discoverability'.
Feedback: A simple thing that the product does which will help you understand that you used the product in the right way. For example the little light on the powerbanks which light up once you plug in a device or photography machines making a 'click' voice once you touch the right button.

## Question/5
## Consider your game. Think about ways you can improve the Players’ Experience using Human-centered design. 

I think one spesific thing that I can do to improve the player's experience while playing the game is starting with a prototype and then asking the test-user to have a video record of them playing the game . This way we can see which parts of the game is hard to understand or concerning for the user, by the way that they might double-click a text or try to type in something that is out of context. This way we can see how a general player would react to our game.
